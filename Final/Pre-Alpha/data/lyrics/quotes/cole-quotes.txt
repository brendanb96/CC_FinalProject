I got a dollar and a dream
I got a dollar and a dream
I got a dollar and a dream
I got a dollar and a dream
Free your mind and everthing will follow
Free your mind and everthing will follow
Free your mind and everthing will follow
Free your mind and everthing will follow
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
1 ---- FOR YOUR EYES ONLY
Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only
For your eyes only
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand
For your eyes only
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With 'lil Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you
For your eyes only
2 ---- FOLGERS CRYSTALS
Now I could be the change that I wanna see
I can heal the world for real if a nigga speaking honestly
Nat Turner in my past life
Bob Marley in my last life, back again
Look in to the eyes of a young nigga
Who survived against all the odds
Look into the eyes of a young nigga
Who's surprised to be alive
I died 5 years ago, the game snatch a nigga’s spirit yo
My resurrection was a miracle
Cause still I rise, it's ill-advised to bet against him
Raised in hell but heaven sent 'em, let 'em diss 'em
Some niggas can't handle the truth
Some niggas don't know they're slaves
I forgive 'em cause I know their ways
They see a black man shine
First thing they do is throw their shade
Word?—errr—I swerve like a Thunderbird on the curb
Where the cops pursuing, I'm not just doing it
Niggas hate like if I make it ain't a spot for you in it
Have to save the rap game cause I watched them ruin it
So you can take my cock and chew on it
Cock sucker I'm a blockbuster
Motion picture, flows consist of potent scriptures
Known to rip a hole through them so-called dopest niggas
Snatch your soul and pose for pictures, holding it
Revenge of the Dreamers, so vindictive
Back for more, that whack shit's over with
For you niggas sleeping this is Folgers Crystals, wow
In the form of a loaded pistol
Bullets rude, they don't even say "Hello", just kiss you, blaow
Burn in hell with a coat that fits you
When you see the devil
You can tell him Cole just sent you now
Yeah, yeah—higher, higher
Yeah, yeah—higher
Now I can be around, shit, whenever you want
I can be around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
I can come around, shit, whenever you want
I can come around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
Me, me, me, me, me, me
3 ---- COST ME A LOT
What can I do?
It’s cost me a lot
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here nigga)
It’s cost me a lot (Nigga this shit right here?)
(Shit homie) It’s cost me a lot (Shit homie)
Just One of Dem Days
A nigga feel like flossin’
A Stone Cold Stunna, bitch I'm Steve Austin
Cool as Drew Brees, I’m blowin' a few Gs
Just to hear them hoes say he’s awesome
He’s awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me
Pulled up beside me in that big body and stunted on me
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me
Well look I’m back bitch, back with an attitude
Buyin' out the bar, cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved
Now I’m tippin' the server a hundred to show my gratitude
Easy, told you I’d be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me
Now I’m living just like the niggas you see on TV
VIP feeling like this club oughta thank me
I hit the bar just so y’all can see I’m ballin’, HD
It’s cost me a lot
Big chains, big whips with wood grain
It’s cost me a lot
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob
It’s cost me a lot
Fast life and till the gas light
Copped the type of shit you couldn’t get at half price
It’s cost me a lot
Look but don’t touch motherfucker, think twice
It’s cost me a lot
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that
Knee deep in the game, my chain heavy
Somebody get the pilot and ask is the plane ready
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we takin' off
Don’t wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can’t take it off
Cause how I’m supposed to shine without the proper bling
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame
Felt naked cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain
Thats five hundred years of swellin', I’m tryna tell 'em
Jacob the Jeweler is cooler now he a felon
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn’t mail him
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him, huh
My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough
Must be the money like Deion with the Jheri curl
White Range, call that motherfucka Larry Bird
I got em hangin' on every word
4 ---- DEAD PRESIDENTS II
These niggas is playing Russian roulette with a full clip, foolish
My crew is foolless no we don't dance all we do is stay two steps ahead
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck
Instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted
Heavy traffic in this rap shit
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high if I dropped I would fall for eleven minutes
So yeah, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train
It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name
It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these Jose Canseco's wanna text-us like Waco
Its hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for?
Some next niggas almost slid in but didn't fit in
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kiddin?
These big wig niggas throwing their bid in
Try not to show stress
I guess the flow is protested like a sit in
I told my niggas we would get in
But that ain't even half the battle
Stay behind like a shadow
Or you catapult
Now if I had a ladder or now even if I had a rope
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!
Heaven or hell, you choose, freedom or jail, you lose
I can't stop, I'm as hot as the devils shoes
Overcame a low life status to blow like Gladys
Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards
I'm nothing like these ho-like rappers
My whole life practice to be the one
What's it like to be Lebron
They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it
The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it
Ill with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel
Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill
No Foreman, try not to call them ladies bees but them hoes swarmin
Now honey, Aye is it destiny or is it money your feelin
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself cause I asked for this
Headed for fame but in my brain, hey can I last in this?
Aye five years I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense
I keep it fresh while these wack niggas rehash and shit
Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit
I pass these niggas, they trynna do it how these other niggas did it
I'm tryna live it how no other nigga ever lived it
5 ---- 2FACE
Hey I got a dolla and a dream
But its all a nigga got so its about that green
And im all up in that spot
Hey
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I fiend about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villains?
Knowing they kill 'em
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God can you blame me? They can’t tame me!
My voice screech through the street..I'm a beast on em!
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!
But never will he run unless you call police on him
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo
Yeah some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans
Wasn’t for the pistol we drop em right where he stands
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then it hit us, thinking bout the close calls from long distance
Ugh as lil niggas in the Ville we was trippin
Type of nosy ass niggas to watching the fight until its over
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer
Foolish what was I thinking? wasn’t trying to be cool, its
Just the thrill of the danger get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him
I'm tired of waiting on my ticket out this mothafucka
Hope they don’t kill me before I get up out this mothafucka
I gotta go
Now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow
Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell
The two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other sides real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings another mother cry still
Why the fuck am I here God?
That nigga died why the fuck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Bless homie we breathin
Cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke so hey I guess we even
Though it blows fighting demons trying to stop from bustin semen
In an unfamiliar bitch I know my niggas feel this shit
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho
My dick took over it ain't never felt this wet before
Im stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Mate this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic
Before I go berserk
I’m so alert, riding down 95
Naw I ain't finna to go to work
I’m headed back home ain't staying that long
I’m chasing dreams shawty im paying back loans
I’m paying dues that a nigga paying tax on
Im tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone
I'm playing daddy to another niggas daughter
Don’t worry even Jesus never saw his real father
It don’t bother me at all though
Yeah say it don’t bother me at all
They got me thinking bout my mom though
Man I can't wait to sing this song I be like, I be like
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
6 ---- RETURN OF SIMBA
In my freshest J's, I ain’t slept in days
Girl, you gonna make me late undressing me
Know you ain’t seen me since yesterday
But, see, I got a date with destiny
Cause this the summer that our life change
Hov asked me, “Is you ready for it?”
I looked around at all his nice things
Told him, “Nigga, you already know it”
Bitch, I’m the man of the year
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Straight through this bitch
Bitch, I’m the man of the year
What you ‘sposed to do when the OG niggas don’t get it?
Lost what was once theirs but they won’t quit it
Homie, it’s a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers
Lemme show you how to move in a room
Full of dudes that don’t got a fuckin’ clue how to do this
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik
My President is black, but my jeweler’s still Jewish
So you know it cost, he makin’ a killing off me
Red diamonds he designing got me shining
Spotlight cover my body, my chain blinding
A cop light runner, they wanna but can’t find him
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica
Seen how he was living, said “I gotta get my weight up”
Formulated my plan, motivated by dreams
Parlayed with my mans, motivated my team
Ced said, “Look, my niggas, we got a foot in”
Being good is good, that’ll get you Drew Gooden
But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footin’
Can’t guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden
Garbage? Hardly, you niggas silly like Chris Farley
So like him, you’ll be gone too early
Mama hands together like 6:30
And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley
All my ’90s niggas is gon’ get it
18 and under, that’s prolly gonna take a minute
I’mma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
I’mma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
At the time of this rhyme, 5 years ’til I know 30
Cole World in the summer brings snow flurries
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, ’cause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doin’ jumpin’ jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin’ laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin’ strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Live by the trigger, ’cause no father figure
Means you don’t got a nigga comin’ ’round to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringin’ home these rotten niggas
Blowin’ reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak fo’
To give the young niggas somethin’ they could reach fo’
You better dream, boy
Yeah, I stunt, but I’m a li’l more realer
When it come from the heart, don’t it feel mo’ iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, I’m a li’l gorilla
So pardon me, man, y’all gon’ have to pardon me
They say I rep that ‘Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me
It’s flowin’ out through my arteries, who hard as me? You JV, I’m varsity
No field trip, ain’t hard to see, this real shit, you R&B
Seen a movie wit’ yo’ bitch in it, and listen it, was starin’ me
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter than Ike Turner temper, you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I’d fail
It’s Judgment Day, I’m here to give you pussy niggas hell
And some food for thought, I can serve a plate
With dessert to take, with dessert to take
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin’ over
It’s like I’m fuckin’ Oprah, well worth the wait
Maybe over your head, I’m ahead of my time
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadin’ my prime
Cause I only made classics, now what that take? Timing
Cole under pressure, what that make? Diamonds
7 ---- FAREWELL
Yeah, farewell
Hey, farewell
All my niggas farewell
Fayettenam
Look, some niggas let their dirt out
Some just keep it all in ‘em
So when a man dies all his secrets go with him
And fade. A part of history no longer known
Done did a lot of dirt I’ll bury with me when I’m gone
When my story’s told, how will they tell it?
Will they say I was a giver or remember I was selfish?
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint?
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon' paint?
Wouldn’t say that I’m a quitter, that's one thing I know I ain't
Will they tarnish, will they taint?
Glorify me, over-think? Say they know me, say I’m great?
Say I’m phoney, I was fake?
Say the things about me they never told me to my face?
I was loved I was hated
Just a nigga with a dream
I’m a liar, I was honest, I was all of these things
When I’m gone let em talk, they discussing who I am
When they bury me just know I wasn't nothing but a man
Wasn’t nothin’ but a man
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
Yeah, yeah
If I should die Lord this here is my will
Reincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville
Let me relive my younger days just once again
Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin
Keeping demons buried in my closet
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now Im blanking out
Those were truly my best days
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid
Gradually turn into me stressin’ how the hell to get paid
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played
Ok, I’m blowing up quickly, I guess the flow is sickly
But yet I can’t forget my past and hope it won’t forget me
Got good grades but A's can’t stop strays so pray for me
Pour liquor for my niggas but hey, don’t wait for me
Cause I’m trying to cheat death, she out to bury my ass
You know the cliche “life's a bitch” well I’m gon marry that ass
And sign a pre-nup
Think back to when we tore the skating rink up
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club
Gave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the world
No sir, came a long way from having momma chauffer
Its hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back
I swear I’m not gon change a thing
I swear I’m not gon change a thing
8 ---- ENCHANTED
Yeah, this is where the
Yeah, this is where the fathers ain't livin'
At least not with us
Might see em round the city and won’t even say wassup
When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors
And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error
Just a small town nigga, big city hustle
Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell
These were our heroes, strictly for them zeros
For that Robert De Niro, niggas reload on them kilo’s
Dodgin them people
Mad at myself cause I done seen some things that I’d rather not tell
Shawty smoke crack and her boyfriend too
And sometimes he touch her daughter how the boyfriends do
Pull up to the club where my boys went too
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue
A nigga on a stretcher and though I never met ya
I'm thinkin' God bless ya, the city try and get ya
Come with me
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La da-da-da, la la la la
Come with me (La da-da-da, la la la la)
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La da-da-da, la la la la
It seems like niggas either feel ya or they tryna kill ya
I face the sky and hope that God ain't acting unfamiliar
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar
They tell me that its God’s will, I’m asking God will ya
Heal a nigga from all this pain, momma smokin' cocaine as it rains out
Am I to blame? Try to stay sane so I came outside
Where they rock with them thangs out
To clear my mind at the same time they blew that boy's brains out
But will it change, its like niggas is free but our minds still in the chains
Brothers killing each other, the blood spill its a shame
Will it ever slow up?
A lot of niggas getting older, but they never grow up
And do they sons like they fathers did and never show up
Don’t even cry about it, just another episode of life
Watch the whole season nigga no re-runs
The devil buying souls nigga no refunds
Man, don’t let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya
Another day, another song
A mother prays, another gone
But still we play like ain't nothing wrong
Like ain't nothing wrong
'Cause ain't nothing wrong
Im not as fast, I’m not as tall
But before I pass
I gotta ball
9 ---- 3 WISHES
Yeah, grew up with killers, I ain't know they was killers
We was just together man, playing Mega-man on Sega, man
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni
Yeah, real black queen, if I had a genie
I wish that she ain't struggle no more
Y'all wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor
You told me when you came to my house this shit was like a timeout
From reality, one night you asked me what I'm crying 'bout
'Cause you was staying over for the weekend
I woke up from out my sleep when I heard mama and my stepfather beefin'
I don't know if he'd been drinkin', but I know this shit got loud
And I heard rumbling from struggling and rolling on the ground
Could never get used to that sound, my mama saying get off me
My tears is tumbling now, I wish that you never saw me
'Cause I felt like a coward, so powerless I was only twelve
I wish I wouldla bust through that door my fucking self
And grab the Glock right off the fucking shelf, if nothing else
Scared a nigga shitless, there goes two of my wishes
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are
Fast forward to our older years, two different paths
You used to talk to me 'bout college, but that shit didn't last
Waste of potential, getting cash, what could I say?
So tired of not having things, you'd never see it my way, too proud to fold
Your demise, one day much to my surprise
My nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size
I asked if it was self defense, he said it was defense of pride
And that they tryna give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five, damn
Not my nigga, the same one that told me
That things always get better, just trust me, don't cry my nigga
The news call him a killer, but he my nigga
Sad shit, ayo genie last wish, free my nigga
10 ---- RICH NIGGAZ
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Who you had to kill, who you had to rob
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top damn it
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator no ladder money
Escalade new Caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga momma never had the money damn
I ain't trippin'
Nigga Jordan I ain't Pippen yeah
Up the steps I ain't slippin'
Tears blood sweat and I ain't crippin'
Here's a song you can sing along with
When you down on some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas you think she out here getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga plus dawg I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund checks used that to float
Momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac
On crack use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Could've drowned, but I grabbed the rope
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
How much for your soul Anna
I hate rich niggas god damn it
Cause I ain't never had a lot damn it
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit and tried to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't there more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power, fuck it more to you
Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watched little Jermaine do his thing before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got, and now a nigga don't paint the same, damn
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Think of old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same
Yeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy, motherfucker, you just afraid of change
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
When I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money can't save your soul
But there go you
11 ---- RUNAWAY
Yeah
Give me my space, Lord ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, na mean I got no time to wait
Love my girl, but I told her straight up "Don't wait up"
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feeling like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wanna be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowing when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wanna let her down, but you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying, "Baby, won't you throw them bands on me?"
And I came to spend
She pop a molly, let the motherfucking games begin
I'm running away
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on desperately
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
I'm holding on
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: "Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour?"
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit
She losing faith in him and he knows the shit
Like what the fuck is a break, don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got till it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't know if I can wait no more
And who can blame her, you complain about
Every time you out, you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is wack, we bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evening
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you...
Unbelievable, seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, "Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is"
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, cause you
Know your wifey loves you, thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?
You know...
12 ---- A STAR IS BORN
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now shining in the broad day light, go figure
A slow transition from a little broke nigga from the Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel, like Jada
I chill now, cop a little ice later
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him!
Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him
No sir, the flow's cold as the shoulders
Of gold digging hoes when a broke nigga approaches
Told you I’m focused, man
I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in; clap for 'em!
13 ---- COLE SUMMER
This right here is not a preview
I need to let it go, yeah
Now this right here is not a preview
Of what the album goin' to bring you, or nothing like that
Sharing things I think quietly, with those that admire me
Remember MTV Diaries? This something like that
I wear my heart up on my sleeve, and I, bleed for you
Cookin' beats hoping' to reach like each one you
When I release, trust if you feel like my shit is weak
When you see me on the street, then speak, I refund you
This sample was yellin' "loop me!", Ms. Hill please don't sue me
Cause I ain't one of these rappers out here frontin' like he got it, nigga
I ain't fuckin' got it, nigga...
Throwing thousands in the strip club with Drizzy
Difference is I'm throwing four, he's throwing fifty
Lord, forgive me
Bitches saying: "You a rapper nigga, ain't you s'pose to tip more?"
I don't see no pussy, baby, ain't you s'pose to strip more?
Confessions of a cheap-ass nigga
But I finally put my Momma in that E class, nigga
And I told her quit her job, but hold your horses
If my next album flops it's back to the post office, both of us, shit
They're saying that's a real possibility
The thought alone is killing me
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go
I think I need to let it go, let it go, let it go
I think I need to let it go
Cause nothing even matters...
Anticipating rain, I can't make the same mistakes again
Them 90s niggas raped the game
And left us with a battered and bruised bitch, with a few kids
The pussy loose, but the truth is I love her, though
She ain't perfect, but who is?
Hoes saying "Cole, you is" don't be silly, ma
Cause really I am just a born sinner the opposite of a winner
Cole summer, I predict another winter
Cause I'm finta, drop knowledge like a five percenter
Fuck the Bilderberg, nigga show 'em God sent ya
Rhyme with the skill, as if Nas went to
College on scholarship met 'pac and said "I'm down with ya!"
And when they wasn't writing rhymes they fucking lined sisters
Puffin' on swishers, what's up Milan?
Everytime I drop I get the net poppin' like Lebron swishes
Kay told me kill ya, and I gotta respect my Mom's wishes
When I let go this how my mind switches
No looking back, don't even want to see my prom pictures
Pardon the rhyme scheme, I guess I'm long winded
Let me switch it now, back to Hell's kitchen now
Up in Hova office like he the fucking principal
Put me in with Stargate, that shit was like detention now
Just tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now
Drop a couple hits and all the dumbies pay attention now
A shame when you learn the ins and outs of the game
And reminisce on little Jermaine in the south
Rappin' out loud, with all the niggas that's cool to you
Just to realize that all them niggas was foolin' you
And they ain't who they said they were
Talk about the streets, but nigga that ain't really where they were
Acting just like there they were, but who am I to judge?
That's neither here or there
Just know I know, my nigga, I just like being aware
If i had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera, at the same time
And put name tags on they titties so I don’t get they name wrong
Screamin' "Game on"
Like Wayne's World, that just came on
I'm rambling now
5 days to finish the album, I'm scramblin' now
Took a break from sampling now
Just to say a few words to this bitch named Summer
June will make four years since I gave you my number
"The Warm Up" dropped, I got hot, you called it a classic
And Jay dropped "Autotune", you wanted him back, shit
Play my position, the whole while still wishin'
A year later Drake put his key in your ignition
And I told my fellas, 
I dropped "Friday Night Lights" in the winter just to make her jealous
Wanted to drop the album in the summer
But the label didn't think that they could sell it
Recoup the first week, I think it ain't shit they can tell us
Do you agree?
It's been a long time coming this thing between you and me
I can't let it go
June 25th. Born Sinner. Bitch
14 ---- I GET UP
I woke up early in the morning
Hoes blowin' up my phone
Ain't no use to small talkin' when they know I'm tryna bone
Fuck 'em
I'll holla later, man
Right now my mind elsewhere
My Mom's healthcare get her out this hell here
A lot of niggas fail
Frail niggas won't prevail here
We seen it all man, niggas can't even spell scared
A Fresh Prince but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you would sell, I'm worried bout my welfare
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
Soon as my dough straight
I throw the wifey in some Dolce
And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves
I get up
Look out the window hope the sun shining
Down on my niggas outhere front lining
I hit the streets and see them boys out here locking up some older head
So Goddamn homey, hold your head
And hold your head
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma your son gonna find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'mma make to the end though
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell 'em I'mma rise
I'm on my
Headed for the sky
I'm on my way
Paint a picture to show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison
Felt you had to resort to crime, man fuck the system
We raisin' babies up in Hades where there ain't no hope
Ain't no fathers, don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollerin' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote
He talk about change
Still we floatin' in the same ol' boat
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel when the President spoke
When he ain't never had to struggle
Ain't never been broke
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close
Trustin' this government like trustin' the devil in oath
For rebel with quotes, I get up
Lifestyle of the young, black and reckless
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions
Like tell me why I ain't got shit
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics
As I sip
Yeah, to all my niggas paper chasin'
I pray for your paycheck
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'
Takin' this shit one step at a time
That real shit is stuck in my mind
But to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine I'm a find a way
Cause hey
Dammit them jobs outthere ain't tryna pay
I pray
Granted nine to five is how you survive
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my Momma in rides
I'm a provide for my seed I'm the soil
I teach 'em bout' loyalty
I teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
I show 'em all the things that my pops was neva showin' me
Treat 'em like a growin' tree with this poetry
I get up
And show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seeds got tommorow
So please niggas raise your kids
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with
I blaze the shit
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma your son gonna find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'mma make to the end though
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell 'em I'mma rise
I'm on my
Headed for the sky
I'm on my way
15 ---- BORN SINNER
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsals
If I died today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless
I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to
"Be all that you can be" posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day that you'd come back and rewind it, singing...
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you: "You the only reason why I don't flip and go insane"
My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em
Don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself
I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but where's the tutor for me
Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than that, I swear
You always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there (I was there)
I was born sinning
But I live better than that (better tonight)
If you ain’t fucking with that
I don’t care (yeah, yeah, yeah)
