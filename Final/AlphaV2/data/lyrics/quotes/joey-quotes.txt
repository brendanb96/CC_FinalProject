1 ---- MISS AMERIKKKA
Why you can't recognize my stride?
Always gotta minimize my pride
Always gon' criticize my moods
I can't make one mistake, it's no room
Feelin' like I gotta leave real soon
I'ma say, "Namaste," and just bloom
But for now, let you run away from the truths
Since you can do anything you want to, anyway, uh
Know some things I ain't supposed to know
It's way deeper than just bein' emotional
Some things you just couldn't keep on the low
Now I'm free, by the truth, I can't be controlled, no more
Nothin' like I used to be back before
Know it must hurt for you to see me evolve
Why you gotta kick me down on all fours?
Why you can't stand to see me stand tall?
Tell me why we got a war?
Why we gotta fight? Why we always gotta spar for?
Why the cops always gotta get called?
Why you always tryna see me in trouble with the law?
I guess some things will never change
Locked in the cycle, tryna break the chains
Handcuffs so tight, nearly slit my veins
This what tough love feels like, feel my pain, uh
Tell me why you don’t love me
Why you always misjudge me?
Why you always put so many things above me?
Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?
Because Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
'Cause Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
Because Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
'Cause Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
2 ---- READY
Badmon representing
Tell me is you ready is you really ready
They ain't really ready they ain't never ready
I was born ready now I'm coming heavy
Now I'm coming heavy
I'm the youngest nigga repping everytime I'm stepping out
And if you step outside your face we pop up right in front of your house
Niggas think because we conscious we don't really get it popping
They forgot we from the bottom
They forgot we had to fight for every nickel, every dollar
Before the money and the power
You could ask my nigga Powers I've been putting in these hours
Plotting domination now the whole world is ours
Tell me why they hating, its cause of what I'm making
And if you a little patient its gon' be what I'm taking
They got me mistaken
Critics try to box me
I feel like Rocky when it come to paparazzi
Somebody stop me, fucking up my kamikaze
I'm on my 47 shit, like how could you not see
Cause we dropping jewels I said we dropping jewels
Temper rising cools prolly see me on the news
Joey got the juice, finally got this nigga loose
Now while I'm free to speak free my nigga Shmurda too
I'm feeling like Victor Cruz a giant from New York
I'm lacing up the boots then I'm going fucking long
So if you trying to score just pass it to me more
Never dropping the ball, always raising the bar
I'm the youngest nigga repping heavy for my city now
All these others niggas thinking they from the south
Bitch I'm the bomb even HOV said it
Though I never signed to ROC and no I don't regret it
You know I'm coming for the top you see me getting bigger
How can you sign if you know you're tryna beat a nigga
When I made it to his office I was seventeen
Like forty floors up I grew a pair of wings
In that moment man I knew I could do anything
Feeling like a young Simba can't wait to be a king
And I never lost my hunger man I stayed hungry
If we started talking numbers man they wouldn't love me
Man I'd rather keep the peace but its getting ugly
But fuck it what I'm about to say is what they didn't want me
60k first week for the Bada$$
200k to this day I know you niggas mad
With the 80/20 split my nigga do the math
My nigga Kirk just outsold Troy Ave
Now they sleep we 'bout to hit 'em with the NYCK next
Got these niggas bread hurt, Limp Bizkit
Its crunch time had to go and get his shit wreck
Got the ninjas on deck and bitches in check
And that's a shot to anybody man I don't feel you
Steezy told me to go hard and niggas ain't hear you
I see the whole future clearer and I'm near it too
And if you really break a leg, I hope they still will cheer you
Man its gon' be a real long time I'mma be around
So make way through the crowd
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown
Just trying to make waves with the sound
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud
And tune them other niggas out
I'm the youngest nigga repping heavy for my city now
Tell these other niggas I'm coming for the crown
3 ---- CHRIST CONSCIOUS
Mother, mothersucker, yeah, oh, this is what you want, huh?
Microphone checker, yo, yo, yo
Uh, motherfuckin' microphone checker
Keep that grip tight, like my Smith & Wesson
Ike with the mic, which nigga tryna turn up?
Hit you with the hurtful fuckin' truth like Sojourner
Motherfuckin' microphone eater
Spittin' hot shit, hit ya dome with the heater
Wouldn't want to be ya, dish lyrical fajitas
Got dragon balls like my name was Vegeta
Motherfuckin' super duper swankin'
Niggas still hatin', pigs want him for the bacon
Take 'em to the slaughterhouse, say we 'bout to order out
Tell 'em we the badass motherfuckers that they heard about
Yes, I guess the word is out, we comin' for the top dollar
Top rottweiler, since I popped my collar
Niggas say they hit us, they ain't ever shot nada
Me? I'd rather not snitch up on my own problems
Cause I'm a microphone killer
Especially when my head is gone off the liquor
Specially educated, heavily medicated
Give me that beat and I'll put you next to Dilla (My nigga)
Flow sweeter than vanilla
Tell these haters beat it, can't Jackson thriller
I'm the nigga that you see when you're in the mirror
Say my name five times, this what I deliver
Which one of y'all niggas really want it with me?
None of y'all niggas, fuck outta here
Beast coast, nigga, Pro Era in your area
This a motherfuckin' nuke that I'm droppin'
The world in my pocket, kick you out your continent
Always drop hot shit, Toroidal Flow keep constant
And I won't stop 'til I reach Christ Conscious, nigga
4 ---- BIG DUSTY
Fuck jumping the broom, honey moons, I, I hit the pot
Soak me up like a mop, know I'm up, know there's levels
Staring down at the devil, hello, guess I got the memo
Pulling strings like Geppetto, you just a puppet, fellow
I came out of the tomb, don’t drop a L, uh
You don't want to see the evils, which I dwell in hell
To excel, this shit never fails, always excels
They been swallowing sons before the double XL
Sex cell, ex ask why it never work out
I guess I exercise too much, when I work out
Shows too turnt out, return home burnt out
Now I got to hear all the shit, that you heard 'bout
Can I live? What, these niggas want me off a bridge?
If I say it's turnt down, do I burn that shit?
Truth is, if it ain't real, I don't feel it
If it don't hit my spirit, I don't get near it
And that's point blank period, know some niggas that fear it
Same niggas who know that we the illest
Lines so deep a great shark is what I reel up
Hit the flow and it can't go realer, my whole camp gorillas, nigga
(Check, check, check it out)
Check my style, check, check, check it out
Check my style, check, check, check it out
Check my style, check, check, check it out
Don't jack my style
I stand juxtaposed to all my Pro's, realest illest niggas I know
See these foes biting the flows, they even jooks the pose
I guess my CD really shaking the coast
Cause this really be the year that I feast, capisce?
Nothing defeats the beast, I speak my piece
Know niggas in the streets that heat seek for me
Release and squeeze
Might put a Halloween between your spleen
Retreat or trickle down to your last pound of green
Know what I mean?
This shit is like taking candy from the babies
Under these rappers is just a bunch of Now and Laters
They too sweet, plus they lease their Mercedes
Can't be second greatest, I'm the best and def your favorite
My flow in-depth nigga, I got my wave up
It's either get your tidal waved, or you could be my neighbor
Cause if I can't eat, then you can't either
I need to know, need the pizza dough, fuck I'm spitting ether for?
Yeah nigga
Reigning rap supreme in this bitch
Cause bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too
Cause bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too
Bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too
Bitches lie niggas lie numbers, too
What the fuck you gon' do when the Era come for you?
And I'm from the blocks where they sell
Cell blocks rock my mental
See them fake thugs that you see before can't even spell
My flow spill with words you can’t pronounce, stories you can’t tell
Check my style
Check, check, check it out
Check, check it out
5 ---- 95 TIL INFINITY
And we smoking, toking potent herb
Preaching spoken words that just might poke your nerves
Hope you ain't scared, my jeep go "Scrrrr"
I peep the obscured, and what ain't normally easy to observe
I swear I'm born abnormally absurd
If I give you a piece of mind, you've been disorderly disturbed
That's my word, flip similes and verbs, now I'm eating
Retreating for seconds and thirds, y'all niggas seasoned
(Oh, you salty)
Don't worry what we ate, you don't want that plate
I combine yours with mine quake, and make the earth shake
Supernatural disaster on you half-ass rappers
Pass the herb to an actual pastor, word to the black lip bastard
I drop knowledge like a Five Percenter
Every time I drop a line, it touch like five placentas
Schooling your offspring, drop heat all spring
And stay hot for five Novembers, I think y'all niggas lost me
Instead of lead slugs, I spreads the love
Like a bed bugaboo does, I'm in the W with your lovable slut
I'm in the walls while you bugging her up
I'll do your girl like this beat, straight fucking it up
Y'all niggas nothing to us, this feels like nuttin' to us
Son, taught your daughter how to bust a nut for fun
Recollect and collect the funds
When she see the sun spit the proceeds when I cum
'99, 'til infinity beyond
Hold my peace full of energy 'til enemies be gone
Until then niggas in my vicinity gone
Peep the melody we on
But they don't know the remedy to these songs
Basic necessities on how to be put on
Cause they see my team, we strong, Beastcoast in your region
If you get dropped you can't rejoin, they wanna know
Whose shoulder we leaning on
But all we do is show them who we leading on
95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
And I just kill it every time
Cause they will never stop for a young black male
Blackmailed in braille that means what he felt
And the very reveal could appeal
Put you on the Alcatraz trail or railroad to hell
Oh well, some of us is taught there is help
The other source is lost in all sorts of wealth
Uh, roots of all evil
The highest stars Evel Knievel
I see through people's door, the world may never know
How my third pupil show, Incognito and cold needles flow
And I don't throw subs, I throw torpedoes
The Don, not Cheadle, this don got a Cornelius fro
Afro punk festivities
This for my negus that's lying with queens like Nefertiti
Waking up to pyramids and big kitties
Gold soul theory, but what is life really
95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines
I used to give a fuck you could find
6 ---- HARDKNOCK
Check it, word word
What's the word word
Yeah, check!
Just got word from my mans on the island
He said he needed guidance
Niggas on the streets is wilding, he look to God but can't find him
So he demand silence from the glaring sirens
The sympathy symphony, only thing playing is the banned violence
No lying niggas just won't let go the iron
They wanna burn your molecules until you let go ions
Treat beef like they let go lions
So don't eye 'em they get the wrong message, wrong methods
Put you on that long stretcher
Too much pressure, God bless ya when the semi wet'cha
They told me "more dress-up" I'm giving too many lectures
And I'm putting in too many effort in my nouns and verbs
Like "they gon' catch up" fuck what you must heard!
But I done puffed enough herb
To be listening to young birds and dumb nerds
I got enough shit on my mind
So I don't need to be stressing and shine, it's fine
One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this
Niggas wanna know what I’m about, I’m bout blowing loud
On the block sporty, Glock 40 in a politician mouth
I take the competition out commission with my composition
Who the kid spitting behind the bars like a con position
Gotta give ‘em time to listen, they’ll soon bump to it
They’ll like me, I kick it like Nike they’ll soon adjust to it
But if you hate I know you must do it
I ain’t mad at you I keep my attitude on "screw it a million bucks should do it"
I’m out for presidents to represent me
Yo chick keep messaging me, who the bestest MC? They be mentioning me
Too hot, I be molesting the beat, fuck math
Teachers should teach us to get Smith & Wesson’s off of the street
So first class be a lesson for me
Fuck what you teaching for some regents, I'm flying over regions
Reaching, all time highs where Jesus can’t reach us
Step to me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace
This is for my niggas, killers, hundred dollar billers
On the block in the rock spot, Glock cocked watching out for cops
All about their cheddar, young guns know nothing that’s better
Like fuck a prison letter, those Beretta’s led us to the lettuce
Relish fetishes, menaces want the senator’s percentages
If you ain't prejudice you still a nemesis
Smoking on the Clematis, get open like a present is
Now your presence is on the premises for them presidents
My city be the genesis for where they think the terror is
They linking terrorists from the Stuy to Lincoln Terraces
Stay on that reckless shit, they leave you left for the dead
Kids don’t play they’ll erase your head in a race for the bread
Children on the corners slinging some regs, popping some meds
Jakes be so deep in cover they be chasing the feds
I be back stage gripping haze breaking my leg
My folks was making the best when they was naked in bed, muthafucka
7 ---- WAVES
Since 9-5, momma been working nine-five
And I know the landlord fed up with our lies
So we pray to the Gods, the Jahs, and the Allahs
To keep us safe and watch our lives
Cause all we tryna do is do good
Put on my hood when I walk through hoods
Cause these niggas these days is loco
You'll get it in ya vocals if you ain't a local
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna go global
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul
And I’m hopeful that me spittin it soulful will have me in the Daily Postal
Flying coastal eatin tofu
Like I told you I know niggas who trash rappin
Worried bout the trendin fashions rather than ascendin' passion
They want me send em tracks but I just send em laughter
Right after I start laughin, they start askin “what happened?"
But back to the chapter
Momma told me follow dreams, should never have to ask her, to
So that’s what I do, became an MC master
Since then it’s been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper
Go ahead ask em "Who is Joey Bad?"
Watch em gasp, asthma, damn it’s so sad
He paused the chatter cause he know he rather back up
Than to admit the kid is hotter than magma
But fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due
Cause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you
It can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals
Or get you 2 to 3 for residue found it your retinue
And they told me not to be so complex
Dumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex
And The Source, alfredo of course
There I go again, steppin out of line, runnin' off course
I heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse
With your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk
For it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north, speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults
I'm sure by now you can assume he never lost
Unless with some form of divorce, or a corpse
Born boss no days off, child labor
Let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes
But it's far from over
Won't stop 'til I meet Hova and my momma's in a Rover
Til I'm an owner of the world's finest motors
I blow like supernovas in your daughter's room on a poster
Known as history's biggest musical composer
No disrespect to Bob Mar, but yeah, another stoner
Marijuana my odor, and when I get older
Hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum
Like 3 times, have 3 kids, I hope
Me & wife can show em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did
I hope they acknowledge the knowledge cuz yeah, they 'gon need it
Cuz when my parents tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it
Couldn't believe it, 'til I saw with my own pupils
Felt bad when I learned that their advice was truly useful
But fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual
Even though over time, my punishments they grew more crucial
Should use the word brutal, cuz my parents mad strict
Hope one day I'll attract the likes of even Madlib
Go gold on mad shit and hear my songs mastered
Until then, all I can do is imagine
I'mma make it all happen
8 ---- KILLUMANITI PART II
And I'm still a beast with these flows
Feeling real low my tree self esteem roll
We drowning out Atlantis can't overflow beast coast
Be more specific next time you shoutin' loud a-mi-go
I am not the star? In fact I plan it all
Fuck what the media write, bitch this is a fire bar
Please don't leave your comment if you are not up to par
No names, putting you in a verse that's too far
You're mundane can't obtain, the knowledge in my brain
My set told me light you up so this that propane
It's Nathan all I gotta do is just spit a flame
No escaping, you in a swimming pool of champagne
You set yourself up for that one mane. The king of New York?
Ha! we ain't just gon' let that one hang
Last nigga got dethroned and you ain't from my zone
The rest of the real niggas is dead and gone
But fuck it I'm Biggie, I'm L, I'm Pun
I’m God’s Son, I’m Pac, Guru all in one
I'm what they predicted before I come
In fact I do it all for them
I'm getting a ugh, I'm getting a ugh from the weak shit
That I hear, no lyrical style come near me
How they gon' try to compare me to what's clearly
Barely, not nearly as rare as me
Swank make hands fold like a rare disease
"How thou art write this? Yo, it's scaring me!"
I got all these rap niggas fucking fearing me
Heard they was looking for war but ain't declaring me
I'm well aware, NY not Delaware
I'm the real king fella here, you more like Prince of Bel-Air
I'm clearing the air, might fire at will
These rap niggas don't want the static for real
Cuz they lines not adjacent to my spectacular skill
If you don't fuck with cinematic stand still
My life's a movie on the real, you can get shot with your hands on the wheel
With your pants at ya heels
9 ---- SURVIVAL TACTICS
Niggas don't want war I'm a martian with an army of spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel right, your intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
We got them niggas P-E-Nuts, like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wood like they light year, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit out to inaugurate
My P.E conglomerates bout to P-E-E on any wanna B-E, weak MC
Air 'em out or leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of the adora, my heart go
Ba boom Ba boom Ba boom boom
It's panic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that K
Like every day in every way and every where you go, just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say, to you is pray
Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and got you slippin'
Another victim, don't know whats hit them – through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best, I'm like you're so right
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga
10 ---- LAND OF THE FREE
Yeah, you know sometimes I think
They don't truly understand me, you know
Cause they don't, yeah, uh
Sometimes I speak and I feel like it ain't my words
Like I'm just a vessel channeling inside this universe
I feel my ancestors unrested inside of me
It's like they want me to shoot my chance in changing society
But how do I go about it? Tell me where I start?
My destiny rerouted when I chose to follow heart
You told to follow suit, but tell me what it do for you?
Except weigh you down, now you trapped inside the cubicle
They built for us
The first step into change is to take notice
Realize the real games that they tried to show us
300 plus years of them cold shoulders
Yet 300 million of us still got no focus
Sorry America, but I will not be your soldier
Obama just wasn't enough, I just need some more closure
And Donald Trump is not equipped to take this country over
Let’s face facts 'cause we know what’s the real motives
Trickery in the system, put my niggas in prison
All our history hidden, ain't no liberty given
We all fit the description of what the documents written
We been lacking the vision and barely making a living
We too worried to fit in while they been benefitin'
Every time you submittin', we all guilty admit it
The Lord won't get you acquitted, but you still ask for forgiveness
Put opiates in syringes then inject his religion
How many times do I gotta tell you I'm a man on a mission
Many times I gotta tell you I don't need no permission
A human with super vision, ain't no livin' condition
I'm reaching out to my children, just hoping that they will listen
Start a new coalition against corrupt politicians
It's not enough pots to piss in, too many murder convictions
Another family evicted, another black man a victim
That's as real as it's getting, you should take recognition
In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners
Still got the last name of our slave owners
In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be their organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners, yeah
We can't change the world unless we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawn out the nebula
And everything I do is and say today is worthwhile
Will for sure inspire action in your first child, yeah
11 ---- FOR MY PEOPLE
You know, yeah
Always wanted to have super powers
You know, uh
Uh, now all heroes don't wear capes
And all villains don’t get away
But all limits eventually fade
I don't wanna be good, nigga, I'm tryna be great
It’s hard when your back's against the wall
And if you got it all to keep your feet up on the floor
That's why I thank the Lord when I wake up in the morn'
'Cause to inform the world the very reason I was born
You can see the power when the mic is in my palm
When I storm across the room, hit the stage and perform
Word is bond, don't be alarmed
Don't let me have to sound the horn, and drop a bomb
Wanna get my mom a crib, with a lawn
Somethin' that my future kids, can run up on
That’s why I always do my best to carry on
Life is like game of chess, don’t be a pawn, my nigga
This for my people, tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero, of my people, yeah?
This for my people
Tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero?
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it’s a plane
No, it's the young black god livin' out his dreams
What you mean? I been up on an ultralight beam
They don't wanna see you fly, they just gonna shoot your wings
Everything ain’t what it seem
Wishin' all these dirty cops, would come clean
Still swervin' on these city blocks, for one thing
My man just copped a 30 shot, protect the team, know what I mean?
Music is a form of expression
I'ma use mine just to teach you a lesson
Rule one: this microphone's a weapon
I'm shootin' out the actions manifested and my passion
Never restin', I'm surpassin' the expectancy
Of life in my direction
Man the section 8 depressin'
Hard to be progressin' through recession and oppression
Not to mention that they had us cell blocked ever since an adolescent
This for my people, tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero, of my people, yeah?
This for my people
Tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero?
12 ---- BABYLON
Yo yo
Badmon representin'
Gone like the wind, I can't seem to win
I know the end is near, but I just don't know when
Turn on to CNN, look at what I see again
It's another black man, died at the white hand of justice
To tell the truth, man, I'm fuckin' disgusted
I fear for the lives, for my sisters, my brothers
Less fortunate than I, let's formulate a plan
I'm sick of holdin' grudges, I'm loadin' in all my slugs and
Aimin' it at the judges, fuck the cops
Fuck the system and the government, you fuckers not
Protectin' and servin'
You more like damagin' and hurtin'
And letting off shots 'til you motherfuckers certain
He ain't breathin', you made it clear
"Fuck your breath, nigga," don't even deserve air
Don't even deserve shit, don't even deserve nothin'
If black lives really mattered, you niggas would do somethin'
Instead we mean nothin', in fact, we being hunted
They don't want us in abundance
They know it's strength in them numbers
That's why they gave you one
The time is comin', no discussion
If you ain't got a gun, then you better start runnin'
Motherfucker, it's the J-O-Z-I-F B-A-D-M-O-N
Come on, bring them M's on in
I'm on the upside now, you can turn 'em M's upside down
We 'bout to win, there's an L for the other side of him
Most greats that you lost, I invite 'em in
To my soul, don't you feel the vibes when I'm channelin'?
The innermost of my spirit been engulfed with plenty gold
'Cause most of them labels throw pennies so
Who you think investin' in penitentiaries though?
Same owners as them labels, same owners of your cable
Spoon feedin' you fables, tryna keep your mind stable
Your eyes blind, and your skin's hazel
The truth is under your nasal but even the air's all fucked up
How we supposed to see stars? Chemical trails above us
Plus bunch of other shit that's undiscovered
Detached from the roots since we set sail, my brothers
That's word to motherland, sold us on stolen land
Visions from brother man, he seen us all holdin' hands
Fifty years later, still see my brothers choked to death
R.I.P. to Eric Garner, only right I show respect
Nowaday they hangin' us by a different tree
Branches of the government, I can name all three
Judicial, legislative and executive
Lock your pops away, your moms, then next the kids
It's all consecutive, I'm just tryna break the cycle
I wonder if I'll do it all before they take my life, yo
Crucify my image, the Lord is my witness
If them Heaven's gates closed
I'ma break all them hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'ma break all the hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'ma break all the hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'ma break all
They say you never know what you got
'Til it's all up and away
And it's so lonely at the top
Sometimes you wanna throw it away
But lately I've been talking to God
He told me Heaven is a way better place
So I'm taking everything that I've got
And I'm running away, I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)
I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)
You better start running, running
Babylon boy them ah coming, coming yeah
You better start running, running
Babylon is coming
Babylon get jealous of we, of we
Just because I walk this way
Babylon get jealous of we, of we
13 ---- LEGENDARY
This is legendary
Always been my mission, never secondary
Gettin' better every January, it's very scary
They gon' recognize eventually, I take it if they don't give it to me
Swear all of it was written for me (yep, yep)
By a higher conscious spiritually (up, up)
Up and away, jump on a plane, get on my wave right now
I want you believe not only in me, but have some faith in yourself
I wish you peace and good health, happiness and some wealth
I threw a coin in the well, 'cause I was feelin' so well
A token of how I felt, never heard if it fell
Not a noise, not a sound, still no reason to doubt
Quality what I sell, quantity in the sales
Quantum physics myself, count a million atoms of cells
This life I'm livin' it out, damn right, my vision is now
Don't let the prisoner cell build a strut to break out
My brothers at the brick house, the undercovers stakeout
Can't you see it's a trap? The type of shit I think 'bout
I sensed they needed my help, that's why I had to reach out
What you think I do it for? My brothers under a spell
It's clear we livin' in hell, the life of a black male
Right out the womb, you come out, and it's a bunch of blackmail
Just waitin' for you to fail, a special room in the jail
With your name, a number on it so you property now
I see it properly now, it's what the poverty 'bout
It's all a game of Monopoly, tryna cop me a house
An elephant in the room until I fit in my tomb
And introduced to my doom, they say the end comin' soon
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control
Legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light
They say the legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light
This is legendary, it's never secondary
I'm getting better every January
The idea of it alone is very scary
I kill my enemies by any means necessary
I said, this is legendary, it's never secondary
Getting better every January
The idea of it alone is very scary
I kill my enemies by any means necessary
14 ---- HAZEOUS VIEWS
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
Will I see you through my hazeus
You ain't running with the apes yet
Apex at the empire state neck
Hand no crown, my niggas take that
In this state of mind, gotta state facts, suspect nigga
Get your wig pushed back tonight, to 1999
Who'd've thought that 19 I might be in my prime
Thought of the right scheme, everything else align
Here's a penny for your thoughts, another one, another one
Eventually the dream was bought
Now that's a real, real, real mind fuck
Might fuck up your mind if you're lighting up
Make sure the ting is tight enough
If you tough, I'm a titan, like Zeus I enlighten them
Kick flows till it's kung-fu fighting them
Is it him, it is you who was nice as him?
I don't see nobody no, no
I don't see nobody no, no
You rap niggas ain't safe yet
I keep the bombs in my basement
When I detonate, you can feel the vibrations
I got your mind shaking, am I right?
My light gon' spark for generations
One day my voice will be heard on every radio station
Cause fake to real ratio changing and it's
Everyday living in this life I see
That in every way they wanna see my life decease
But I survive the question is for how long
Since my homie died, I been trying to hold on
The happy days of my life is now all gone
But I cope with that weed I smoke and writing these songs
But it's should I stay should I go? Oh!
Should I stay should I go? Oh!
I don't know, I don't know
Lord please let me know
Every thing cool like in the state of mind
That this state of mine correct, cool, calm, collect
Deflect the corrupt with intellect
I talk too much, the jig is up he has risen up
From a division of most kings
With their vision, positioned for precision
It's mind splitting and soul uplifting
But still feel so trapped in the solar system
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus, will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey Jesus, will I ever get to see you through my hazeus?
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
Will I see you through my hazeus view?
If I see you through my hazeus view?
See you through my hazeus view?
See you through my, my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus, my haeus view?
And I see you through my, my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus, my haeus view
15 ---- PAPER TRAILS
Money ain't a thing if I got it
Yo, sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in
Closed-minded men
Pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and Balenciagas Balance my saga with the Henny agua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava
With just a penny I could multiply my worth
And make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
The kid ain't been the same
Since Biggie smacked me at my christening
Watch what you dishing and please play it safe
Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep ducking down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who booked the clown? I lock jaws like a blue nose
Foes keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them
The Pros been on a mission
Listen, enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' Macs, I raise steaks to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis
I got dreams selling arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm cracking a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due
Shit is really real out here
I said shit is really real out here (It ain't easy)
Just trying to get a deal out here
(Money ain't a thing if I got it)
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene
Cause cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
(Won’t sign to no major if no wager) (money ain't a thing)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills (It ain't easy)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough
