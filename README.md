Edit Notes for 5/2/17 9:16AM
Completed Comments
Reorganized Some Code Structure For Easy Formatting / Readability
Added Scalability (Removed Concrete Values in Place of Variables)
--Someone Can Take Code and Input Different Sized Images
--Canvas Can Be Scaled To Any Size (Though Warning: Images Use A Lot Of Processing, Anything Passed ~900*900 Will Use A LOT Your Processing)
Did Not Add Another Rapper

Edit Notes for 4/29/17 2:38PM
Added Many Comments
Tightened up Input Functionality
Recursion Image Will Not Be Added, Requires Too Much of an Overhaul and Change of Core Input Mechanics
Things To Consider:
--More Comments
--Additional Rapper

Edit Notes for 4/27/17 5:55PM
Added Backspace Functionality
Reset Functions Added
Matched Up to OpenProcessing, Bugs Are Cleaned Up
Future Functionality To Still Incorporate:
--Tighten Up Input Mechanics/Processing--
--Maybe Add a Recursion Image--

Issues That Are Still Present:

from going back and forth from OpenProcessing and Sublime--
--Will Have to Continue Checking Old GitHub Sketches--
Future Functionality To Still Incorporate:
--Tighten Up Input Mechanics/Processing--
--Maybe Add a Recursion Image--
--Create A Reset Method for Abstract Image to Restart Lyrics and Song--

While Working to Move Towards a Better Beta Version,
New Functionality and Mechanics That Were Not 
In Previous Versions Were Added, Rather Than Refining Old Ones
--These New Mechanics Crashed The Previous Early Beta Sketch--
--I Am Currently Working on Restructuring The Code in Sublime--
--Might Take A While--
