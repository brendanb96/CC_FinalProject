Comments Were Added To First Beta,
Some Minor Bugs Were Corrected
--Matching Sublime With Correct OpenProcessing Sketch
Issues That Are Still Present:
--Quote Image Processing Somehow is Messing Up Perhaps It Is a Copy&Paste Issue
from going back and forth from OpenProcessing and Sublime--
--Will Have to Continue Checking Old GitHub Sketches--
Future Functionality To Still Incorporate:
--Tighten Up Input Mechanics/Processing--
--Maybe Add a Recursion Image--
--Create A Reset Method for Abstract Image to Restart Lyrics and Song--

While Working to Move Towards a Better Beta Version,
New Functionality and Mechanics That Were Not 
In Previous Versions Were Added, Rather Than Refining Old Ones
--These New Mechanics Crashed The Previous Early Beta Sketch--
--I Am Currently Working on Restructuring The Code in Sublime--
--Might Take A While--
