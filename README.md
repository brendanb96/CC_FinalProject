# CC_FinalProject


Open Processing Link to Early Beta
https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/423131
(Sketch Takes a While to Load All Data)

Edit Notes for 4/25/17 6:45PM
Last issue of sketch crashing was resolved:
--Incorrect Scope Calls, Infinite For Loop, and Incorrect Timer Usage--
New Issues:
--Quote Image Processing Somehow is Messing Up Perhaps It Is a Copy&Paste Issue
from going back and forth from OpenProcessing and Sublime--
--Will Have to Check Old GitHub Sketches--
Future Functionality:
--Tighten Up Input Mechanics/Processing--
--Maybe Add a Recursion Image--
--Create A Reset Method for Abstract Image to Restart Lyrics and Song--

Edit Notes For 4/23/17 11:23AM
While Working to Move Towards a Better Beta Version,
New Functionality and Mechanics That Were Not 
In Previous Versions Were Added, Rather Than Refining Old Ones
--These New Mechanics Crashed The Previous Early Beta Sketch--
--I Am Currently Working on Restructuring The Code in Sublime--
--Might Take A While--
