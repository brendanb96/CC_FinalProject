I’m willin’ to die for this shit, I done cried for this shit
All my grandmas dead, so ain’t nobody prayin’ for me
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives


Fuck your ethnicity
What the fuck is you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines


Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
If I was the president, I'd pay my mama's rent
Be all you can be
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
